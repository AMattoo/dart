          Self-adaptation allows a system to
          change its behavior or structure in response to changes in
          the environment in which it operates or the system itself,
          so that it continues to satisfies its requirements despite
          these changes. The adaptations are planned and executed in
          terms of adaptation tacticsâ€”actions that perform a change in
          the system. Although some adaptation tactics can be almost
          instantaneous (e.g., a parameter change), other tactics take
          some time to complete; that is, these adaptation tactics
          have latency.
          <br><br>
          <h4>Proactive Latency-Aware Self-Adaptation</h4>Most
          adaptation approaches ignore tactic latency when deciding
          how to adapt, and that may result in suboptimal adaptations
          for two reasons. <i>First</i>, if there are two possible
          tactics the system could use, and one is faster than the
          other, the system is not able to select the faster
          tactic. <i>Second</i>, if tactics have latency and the
          system reacts to changes, the change in the system will be
          late with respect to when it is needed.  We
          propose <i>proactive latency-aware adaptation</i> as a way
          to address these two problems and achieve better
          effectiveness in self-adaptation. Our approach takes into
          account the latency of adaptation tactics when deciding how
          to adapt. In addition, to make sure the system adapts in a
          timely manner, the approach is proactive, so that it can
          initiate adaptations with the necessary lead time.
          Proactive adaptation requires making decisions based on
          predictions of the near future state of the environment. In
          the case of DART systems, these predictions can be based on
          a combination of the physical movement of the system
          elements in space and time, and information about the
          relevant characteristics of the environment. Nevertheless,
          these predictions are subject to uncertainty. Our approach
          explicitly considers the uncertainty of these predictions
          when deciding how to adapt.

          <h4>Probabilistic model checking approach</h4> Probabilistic
          model checking is a formal technique to verify systems with
          stochastic behavior. By analyzing the composition of a model
          of the system with a model of the stochastic behavior of the
          environment, we can leverage probabilistic model checking to
          take into account the uncertainty of the environment
          predictions. In particular, we use models in which the
          adaptation decisions are left as nondeterministic choices,
          and exploit the ability of the PRISM probabilistic model
          checker to synthesize strategies or policies that resolve
          those choices in a way that maximizes the expected value of
          an objective function. In that way, we can make adaptation
          decisions that take into account the uncertainty of the
          environment predictions by exploring all the possible
          evolutions of the environment in a finite look-ahead
          horizon. More details about this approach can be found in
          the following publication:<br><br>

          <h4>A faster solution approach</h4> The previous approach
          involves two steps done by the model checker. First, the
          model checker builds a Markov decision process (MDP) from a
          formal specification of the system. Then, the model checker
          solves the MDP, computing an optimal policy to achieve the
          adaptation goal. This whole process is done at run time
          every time an adaptation decision has to be made. We have
          developed another approach that decouples the construction
          of the MDP from its solution. That way, the construction of
          the MDP from formal specifications can be done offline, and
          the solution is the only part that remains to be done at run
          time. In addition, the solution algorithm leverages the
          structure of the problem to reduce the number of states of
          the environment that have to be considered at each
          iteration. In our experiments we have found the decision
          time to be reduced 10 times with respect to the decision
          based on probabilistic model checking. Additionally, the
          approach can achieve adaptation goals that involve the
          maximization of some objective function subject to
          probabilistic constraints. For example, it can maximize the
          expected number of objects detected, subject to surviving the
          mission with 95&#37; probability.

          approach can be found in the following publication:<br><br>
